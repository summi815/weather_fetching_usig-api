# weather_fetching_usig-api
Excited to share my achievement: a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated an API to fetch real-time weather data, presenting current conditions with a polished user interface. Strengthened web development skills and gained hands-on experience in API integration. A successful and engaging project.
